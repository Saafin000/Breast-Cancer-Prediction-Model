## 📊 **Performance & Features**

| Feature | Before (Multiple Files) | After (Single main.py) |
|---------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Entry Points | 5+ different CLI files | 1 file with 2 modes |
| File Size | Scattered across files | 62KB single file |
| Functionality | Duplicated features | Unified implementation |
| Maintenance | Update multiple files | Update one file |
| User Experience | Confusing file choice | Simple `python main.py` |
| API Compatibility | Separate server file | Built-in `--api` mode |

## 🎉 **Result**

**Before:** Multiple confusing CLI files + separate API server
**After:** Single `main.py` with dual-mode functionality

### **Perfect Simplicity**
```bash
python main.py     # 🩺 Medical screening (your primary use case)
python main.py --api  # 🌐 Web server (for developers/integration)
```
